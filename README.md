# DotSwarm

**Better quality, fewer tokens.**

A Codex plugin that keeps the expensive model running your session for the work that needs its judgment, and hands everything else to cheaper help. A team of inexpensive DeepSeek Flash agents, running inside the DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`), does the reading and the routine work: a `brief` swarm reads the sources and returns one condensed brief, a `build` swarm does work a spec fully determines, and a `verify` swarm runs every check and fixes mechanical defects so the coordinator never reads the output. Three lean Codex subagents cover what a swarm cannot: `dotswarm-designer` for taste, `dotswarm-imager` for generating images, and `dotswarm-writer` for prose that has to persuade. The coordinator decides, arbitrates, and answers the owner; it receives compressed state, steers on exceptions, and reads only briefs, escalations, and the questions meant for the owner.

The subagents are plain Codex agents, so DotSwarm is useful with or without a DeepSeek key: without one you get the subagents and the skill that routes work to them, and the swarm tools start working as soon as you add a key.

```
Codex session (any model) = the coordinator
  ├─ plugin: dotswarm  (skill + zero-dependency MCP server)
  │    └─ one dsh runtime per swarm   (profile "swarm" = dsh-base + sdk-app + agent-team)
  │         ├─ Team Lead (Flash)       plans tasks, spawns teammates, reviews, reports
  │         ├─ teammates (Flash)       explore / implement / test / design / review
  │         ├─ task board + mailbox    upstream Agent Teams (durable, in the Lead session log)
  │         └─ findings ledger         DotSwarm, over MCP, one JSONL per swarm
  └─ Codex subagents (installed by swarm_setup, own context, no DeepSeek needed)
       ├─ dotswarm-designer  taste: direction, design systems, brand, first instances
       ├─ dotswarm-imager    generates images from a written specification
       └─ dotswarm-writer    prose people read
```

## Install

Requirements on the machine running Codex: Node.js 22+, git, npm, and pnpm (used once to install the Agent Teams bundle). A DeepSeek API key is needed for the swarms; the subagents work without one.

In the Codex desktop app: **Plugins > Add > Add a marketplace**, paste `https://github.com/Druidia-Bot/DotSwarm`, then install **DotSwarm**.

With the Codex CLI on Windows:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Druidia-Bot/DotSwarm/main/install-codex.ps1 | iex
```

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Druidia-Bot/DotSwarm/main/install-codex.sh | sh
```

That is all the subagents need: they install themselves into `~/.codex/agents` the first time the plugin's server starts, and work with no key and no further setup.

Swarms need the DeepSeek side. In a fresh Codex session, ask it to set DotSwarm up. The `swarm_setup` tool installs the pinned DeepSeek Harness and Agent Teams bundle into your local DotSwarm data directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DotSwarm` on Windows, `~/.dotswarm` elsewhere; override with `DOTSWARM_HOME`) and checks for your key. Put your key in the file it names:

```
<data dir>/dsh-home/.env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
```

`swarm_doctor` confirms everything, including which subagents are installed. Claude Code users can add the same repository as a marketplace; the plugin manifest for it is included.

## Updating

Codex keeps its own copy of the plugin, so new releases do not arrive on their own. Close every Codex window and session first; a running one holds the old copy open and the install reports `Access is denied`. Then, with the Codex CLI:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade dotswarm
codex plugin add dotswarm@dotswarm
```

Then start a new Codex session (open sessions keep the old version) and ask it to check that DotSwarm is set up, which installs a newer DeepSeek Harness if the release pins one. In the desktop app, remove the DotSwarm marketplace under **Plugins** and add it again. `codex plugin list` shows the installed version; compare it with the [latest release](https://github.com/Druidia-Bot/DotSwarm/releases).

## What the coordinator gets

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `swarm_start` | `mode` `brief` (read and condense into `brief.md`), `build` (work a spec fully determines), `verify` (check, fix mechanical defects, escalate judgment), or `refactor`; objective, plan, acceptance criteria, context packet (objective and context can instead be absolute file paths in `objective_file` and `context_file`), absolute workspace, `allowed_paths` (git pathspecs; the result lists every changed path outside them), `max_agents`, `isolate`, `design`, `brief_words`, model and effort |
| `swarm_status` | compressed state; `wait_ms` blocks until the swarm needs you (plan, question, failure, warning or tool-error burst, idle/stopped/failed) and `wake` names the reason; `wake_on: "any"` wakes on every change; `since_finding` returns only new ledger entries; lists open questions, filtered tool errors, and a cost line |
| `swarm_steer` | one instruction to the Lead, delivered as its next turn and immediately as a ledger entry |
| `swarm_task_add` | hand the Lead a new board task instead of editing the workspace yourself |
| `swarm_inspect` | drill into `tasks`, `findings`, `roster`, `mail`, `errors`, `lead`, `member:<name>`, `events`, `prompts` |
| `swarm_result` | the Lead's report split into Summary, Changes, Verification, Unresolved, Handoff; `ledger.open` (warnings and failures nobody answered); `readFirst` (changed gates, scripts, config, schema, forms, auth); `git diff --stat`; `ownerQuestions` (every question for the owner at an approval gate, numbered and complete); and writes `handoff.md` so the next stage can start in a fresh session |
| `swarm_stop` | shut the runtime down; workspace changes stay |
| `swarm_resume` | continue a detached or finished swarm on the same worktree, seeded with the old board, the whole ledger, and the last report; refuses a swarm another live server process still owns |
| `swarm_list` | swarms known to this server, including detached ones and `owned-elsewhere` ones still running in another server process |
| `swarm_setup`, `swarm_doctor` | install the runtime into the data directory; report health |

The bundled `swarm` skill tells the coordinator how to use them: a brief swarm reads for it, it writes the creative and judgment work itself in few large turns, it hands off anything a spec and a command fully pin down, a verify swarm checks the result, and it starts each stage in a fresh session from `handoff.md`. It does not read what the swarm wrote; it reads the brief and the escalations. Set `design: true` for anything a person will look at: the team switches to the image-capable `deepseek-flash` model and must render each screen with Playwright at 390x844 and 1440x900, view it with `read_image`, critique it, and iterate at least twice, keeping screenshots outside the repository.

Isolation is on by default: in a git repository the team works in a worktree under the data directory on branch `swarm/<id>`, and `swarm_result` reports the branch for review and merge. Pass `isolate: false` to work directly in the checkout.

### Optional: DotBot skills

DotSwarm works fully on its own. When the DotBot client is installed and a DotBot key is configured, the coordinator also gets vetted, signed skills for the team:

- `swarm_find_skills` searches the DotBot catalog once per work unit while the coordinator plans, and `swarm_start` accepts `skills: [{ id, work_unit, content_hash }]`.
- Each assigned skill is downloaded and verified by the DotBot client into the swarm's directory (`<data dir>/swarms/<id>/skills/`, never the workspace), its id and content hash are recorded in the findings ledger, and the Lead is told to put the skill folder in the description of every task for that work unit.
- `swarm_resume` fetches the same versions again by content hash; if that fails, it reuses the previous swarm's verified copy when it is still on disk.
- Anything that goes wrong (no client, no key, network, a slow search, a skill that fails verification) is noted and the swarm runs exactly as it would without DotBot. `swarm_doctor` reports whether DotBot is connected and, if not, why.

DotSwarm ships none of DotBot's code. It looks for the client library at `DOTSWARM_DOTBOT_CLIENT` (the client folder or its `index.mjs`), then at a `dotbot` plugin beside this one in the same marketplace, and reads the key the way the client does (`DOTBOT_API_KEY` or the client's config file).

## Subagents: taste and images

A swarm is cheap and thorough, but it cannot generate images and its taste is weaker than a frontier model's. `swarm_setup` installs three lean Codex subagents in your Codex home (`~/.codex/agents`) to cover that:

| Agent | Model | For |
|---|---|---|
| `dotswarm-designer` | `gpt-6-astra` | visual direction, design systems, logo and brand, the first instance of each page or screen type, judging finished screens |
| `dotswarm-imager` | `gpt-6-luna` | generating raster images from a written specification |
| `dotswarm-writer` | `gpt-6-sol` | prose people read where voice and persuasion matter |

Each starts with about half the usual context (memories, plugins, app guidance and the skills catalog are off: measured 22.2k to 11.5k tokens per turn) and returns paths and a summary, never content. Edit them freely: remove the `# managed-by: dotswarm` line from a file and setup will leave it alone. Change the `model` lines if your account has different models.

## What is ours and what is upstream

| Piece | Owner |
|---|---|
| Agent loop, tools, sandbox, sessions, task DAG, mailbox, `spawn_teammate`, `wait_agent` | DeepSeek Harness (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`, pinned, installed into the data directory at setup) plus `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile` |
| Stdio JSON-RPC client for the harness SDK protocol | `src/dsh-client.mjs` |
| Swarm lifecycle, event folding, compressed status, persistence, resume, worktrees | `src/swarm.mjs`, `src/swarm-state.mjs` |
| Lead prompt, worker protocol, review standard, quality bar, brief, verify, design, and refactor sections, report format | `src/prompt.mjs` |
| Result digest, risky-file list, and `handoff.md` | `src/digest.mjs` |
| Findings ledger and its MCP server | `src/findings.mjs`, `src/findings-server.mjs` |
| Minimal MCP stdio server | `src/mcp.mjs` |
| Profile generation, setup, doctor | `src/profile.mjs`, `src/setup.mjs` |

## Privacy and cost

The generated harness home disables telemetry, the upstream session-log contributor, and plugin-inventory contributions. Each swarm writes `<data dir>/swarms/<id>/` with the Lead prompt, an `events.jsonl` of every runtime notification, the findings ledger, screenshots, a `scratch/` directory where the team is told to put probes and red-proof copies, and its state. `swarm_result` lists any untracked file or ignored entry that appeared in the workspace after the swarm started, so a probe left behind is visible. DeepSeek is charged for every team member. The coordinator's cost is set by how many turns it takes times how much it has read, so the skill keeps it to few, large turns: it reads the brief instead of the sources, writes its own part in batches, waits on `swarm_status` instead of polling, and reads only escalations, never the swarm's output. Set `DOTSWARM_PRICE_INPUT_PER_M` and `DOTSWARM_PRICE_OUTPUT_PER_M` (USD per million tokens) for a dollar estimate in the cost line, and `DOTSWARM_PRICE_CACHE_READ_PER_M` to include prompt tokens served from the provider cache, which bill at their own lower rate. Set `DOTSWARM_DEFAULT_MODEL` and `DOTSWARM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` to change the model and provider a swarm uses when `swarm_start` names none, for example when the harness profile points at another endpoint whose model ids differ; `swarm_doctor` and the `swarm_start` schema report the effective defaults.

## Development

```bash
cd plugins/dotswarm
npm install            # test dependencies only
npm test               # fake runtime: client, folding, findings server, plugin launcher, swarm lifecycle, resume
npm run setup          # real dsh into the data directory
npm run doctor
npm run smoke:live     # spends tokens: one-teammate swarm creating a file in a temp dir
npm run monitor        # replay any swarm's log from outside the server
```

## Known limits

- Agent Teams is upstream-experimental: one process, one shared checkout, advisory write scopes, no automatic ownership release. Isolation and the reviewer role exist because of this.
- No mid-turn cancel exists in the SDK protocol; `swarm_stop` ends the runtime.
- Resume is seeding, not reattachment: the harness's SDK server only creates sessions, so a Codex restart ends the old teammates' turns. Their work on disk and the ledger survive and feed the successor team.
- The workspace-write sandbox on Windows blocks spawning native toolchain binaries, so the default permission mode is full access; the objective's boundaries are what keep the team out of other repositories.
