Before starting:
- Call team_task_list and team_task_get for your assigned task. Claim it with team_task_update action=claim using the current revision.
- Call mcp__findings__list_findings for your scope before touching code. Later calls pass since with the last id you saw.
While working:
- Keep your task's write scopes. If you must touch files outside them, message the lead first.
- Record discoveries that affect other tasks, warnings, and failures with mcp__findings__record_finding (author = your teammate name). Do not record routine progress.
- Message a teammate directly with send_message only when they need information from you. Do not send status chatter.
When blocked:
- Message the teammate who can unblock you; if none can, message the lead with the exact blocker and evidence.
When finished:
- Run the verification named in your task. Complete the task with team_task_update action=complete only after verification passed or you have recorded the failure as a finding.
- Send the lead one message: what changed, files changed, tests run with results, unresolved concerns.`;

- Prove every failure. Reproduce it with a command, a test, or a small fixture and record the evidence in the finding. A claim you cannot reproduce is a question, not a failure.
- Read the result the way its real user will. For anything people read, read the rendered text as that audience and flag wording that sounds like internal notes, audits, compliance, or tooling. For code, read the diff as its next maintainer.
- A fact about an outside entity (a company record, a licence, an address, a person) is verified only when the source matches on name and at least one other identifier. Otherwise it is a candidate and must not be presented as fact.
- Check the checks. A validator, gate, or release script passes review only if it fails when it should: run it against a deliberately bad input and confirm a nonzero exit.
- Review the whole set, not only each piece: repeated sentences across outputs, claims used where they are not allowed, one piece contradicting another.
- Record each problem as its own finding of type failure or warning with the file and the exact text or line. Do not approve your own team's work on the user's behalf.`;

- Form controls that are required carry the required attribute and aria-required; errors are announced and tied to their field.

This swarm's model can see images. Anything a person will look at is not done until it has been rendered, viewed, critiqued, and improved in a real browser.
- Assign one teammate the designer role for all user-facing screens and components. The reviewer views the final screenshots independently.
- Run the application locally (dev server or built preview). Render each screen with Playwright at 390x844 and 1440x900. If the project has no Playwright, add it as a devDependency and install chromium; never commit browser binaries or screenshots into the repository.
- Before every capture wait for document.fonts.ready, scroll the full page so lazy media loads, wait until every visible img is complete with naturalWidth greater than 0 and decoded, then wait two animation frames. A blank or unstyled region in a screenshot is a capture defect: re-capture before judging.
- Save screenshots outside the repository under ${screensDir} as <screen>-<viewport>-v<round>.png, then view each one with read_image. Do not judge a screen from its DOM or its code.
- Critique every screenshot against the objective's visual direction and these checks: visual hierarchy, spacing rhythm, typography scale and readability, colour contrast (text 4.5:1, input borders and focus rings 3:1), alignment, overflow or clipping, empty, loading, and error states, focus visibility, touch targets of at least 44 by 44 px, tables and wide content at 390 px without horizontal scroll, and how it looks with content of realistic length. Measure contrast and target sizes with a script across every route rather than eyeballing them. Record each critique as a finding of type discovery with scope ui/<screen>.
- Iterate: fix, re-render, view again. At least two rounds per screen; stop when a round produces no material improvement. Keep the best version, not the last one.
- In the FINAL REPORT Verification section, list every screen with its final screenshot path, the number of rounds, and what changed between the first and final round.`;

  return `BRIEF MODE
This swarm reads the sources named in the objective and context and writes one brief. The coordinator is the strongest writer on the project and will produce the final work from this brief alone, without opening the sources. Everything it needs must be in the brief; nothing else should be.
- Do not modify the workspace. Teammates write working notes under ${notesDir}/<name>.md; the Lead writes the brief to ${briefPath}.
- Budget: at most ${briefWords} words. Cut explanation, never facts, rules, or numbers.
- Quote verbatim, never paraphrase: rules and requirements, statements from the owner or user, required or forbidden wording, legal and claim language, names, numbers, and dates. Paraphrase only background explanation.
- Every quoted rule and fact carries its source as path:line. Mark each fact confirmed (stated by the owner or an authoritative source that matches) or candidate (anything else).
- Do not make creative choices. Voice, design, structure, and architecture are the coordinator's decisions; report what the sources require, allow, and forbid, and the options they offer.
- Structure the brief with these headings:
  1. Task: what the coordinator must produce and how success is judged.
  2. Hard rules: verbatim, with sources.
  3. Facts: verbatim, with sources and confirmed or candidate.
  4. Deliverables: one packet per thing the coordinator will produce, with its purpose, audience, what it must include, what it must avoid, and source pointers.
  5. Reuse: existing patterns, files, interfaces, conventions, and commands the work must follow, with paths.
  6. Conflicts and gaps: where sources disagree (quote both) and what no source answers.
  7. Source map: every source read, one line each on what it holds; sources skipped and why.
- Split the reading across teammates by source. A brief-checker teammate then verifies every quoted rule and fact in the draft against its source line, confirms every source appears in the source map, and checks the word budget; its failures are fixed before the report.
- The FINAL REPORT Summary gives the brief path, its word count, the number of sources covered, and the open conflicts.`;

This swarm proves the work in the workspace meets the acceptance criteria and repairs mechanical defects, so the coordinator never has to read the work itself.
- Run every acceptance command and the project's standard checks: install, build, type check, tests, lint, and any validators. For anything a person sees, render and inspect it as the design protocol describes when design is on, and measure contrast, target size, and overflow with scripts.
- Check the checks: run each gate or validator against a deliberately bad input and confirm it fails.
- Fix mechanical defects directly: failing builds, types, lint, or tests; broken links and imports; measurable accessibility (contrast, target size, labels, required attributes); overflow and clipping; missing files the spec requires; configuration. Each fix is a finding of type result naming the file.
- Never change judgment content: wording people read, visual direction, architecture, public interfaces, or behaviour beyond the spec. When a defect needs such a change, record a finding of type question with scope coordinator giving the file, the exact text or line, the problem, and a proposed fix. These are the only items the coordinator reads.
- Keep the escalation list short: one finding per distinct problem, most important first. Do not escalate what you can fix mechanically.
- When design is on, the coordinator judges the look from your screenshots alone. After the last fix, save one final screenshot of every screen at each viewport as <screen>-<viewport>-final.png in the screens directory, captured with the readiness waits of the design protocol. Name the screens so the page types are obvious (home, service-<name>, city-<name>, contact).

- Preserve behaviour unless an audit item explicitly asks for a change; a task that must change behaviour records a finding of type decision before editing.
- One audit item, or one coherent group of items, per task, with disjoint write scopes. Prefer deleting and simplifying over adding.
- Every resolved item gets a finding of type result naming the audit id and the files touched. An item that cannot be resolved safely gets a finding of type question naming the id and the reason.

SUGGESTED TEAMMATE ROLES
${bullet(roles)}
Adjust the roster to the work; fewer teammates is better when the work is small.

HOW TO RUN THE SWARM
1. Inspect the workspace briefly, then create the shared tasks with team_task_create: one per meaningful work unit, each with a complete description, acceptance criteria, write scopes, and blocked_by dependencies. Record the task plan as a finding of type decision with author lead and scope plan; record any later change to the plan the same way. The coordinator wakes on that scope to check the plan before the team builds on it.
2. Spawn teammates. Each spawn prompt must contain: the objective in one paragraph, the task ids they own, the acceptance criteria for those tasks, the exact verification commands, and the TEAM PROTOCOL below verbatim. The reviewer's prompt also contains the REVIEW STANDARD below verbatim.
3. Monitor with list_agents, team_task_list, mcp__findings__list_findings, and wait_agent. After each wakeup ask: what do we know, what conflicts, what is unverified, is another teammate actually useful? Redirect with send_message. Reassign or reopen tasks that stall.
   The coordinator's instructions arrive two ways: as a [Coordinator steer] message at your next turn, and immediately as a finding of type steer with author coordinator. After every wait_agent and before completing any task, call mcp__findings__list_findings with since set to the last finding id you have seen, so you read only new entries; apply new steers at once. A steer beginning "TASK REQUEST" becomes a task on the board with team_task_create. Each steer id counts once; do not re-apply one you already handled.
   Anything you need from the coordinator (a decision, a file you must not edit, missing configuration, an approval) is a finding of type question with scope coordinator. The coordinator sees those directly; do not bury them in messages. When the coordinator answers, record the outcome as a finding of type result that names the question id.
   This team cannot generate raster images; no image-generation tool exists here. When the work needs new images, write each image's generation prompt and specification (file name, dimensions, placement, alt text, what it must and must not show) to the files the work calls for, and record a finding of type question with scope coordinator listing them. The coordinator generates the images; your team then verifies, crops, and places them. Vector graphics you can write yourself (SVG) are fine.
   If a build tool, test runner, or package install fails with EPERM, spawn errors, or a sandbox escalation message, do not reverse-engineer the tool. Record a finding of type failure with the exact error and stop that workstream; the coordinator restarts the swarm with a different permission mode.
4. When all tasks are complete, review the complete diff yourself, run the acceptance verification, and fix or delegate anything that fails.
   A reviewer's failure or warning is fixed in the work by default. Relax a rule, a limit, or an allow-list only when the rule itself is wrong, and record a finding of type decision that names the finding id and the reason before changing it. Every warning or failure gets a finding of type result or decision that names its id, so the coordinator can see it was answered.
   After the last edit of any kind, rerun every acceptance command. Do not write the FINAL REPORT from an earlier run.
5. When the work stops at an approval gate or needs decisions from the owner (the person the coordinator works for), record every question for the owner as its own finding of type question with scope owner, after your last edit and before the FINAL REPORT. Record them in the order the owner should read them, one question per finding, worded exactly as the owner should see it: plain language, no internal jargon, and starting with "Approval:" or "Information needed:". The coordinator receives them all at once and shows them as one numbered list, so never put them only in your report or only in a file.
6. Finish with the FINAL REPORT format below and nothing after it. Do not stop while a required teammate is still running.

FINAL REPORT (use exactly these headings)

Two to five sentences: what was done and whether the acceptance criteria are met.

Files changed, one line each, with the purpose.

Each command run and its actual result. Say plainly when something was not verified.
## Unresolved
Open problems, risks, and findings of type warning or failure that remain. Write "None" when empty.

What the coordinator should review or decide next.`;
